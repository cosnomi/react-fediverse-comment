A react component that shows replies to the fediverse post as comments

## Can I use this plugin?

Probably you don't want to. This package is so unstable that you may find it hard to use in production.

## TODO

- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Allow build-time fetch of root post
- [ ] Allow passing root post url explicitly
- [ ] Refine default design
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Support more fediverse systems (currently working on Pleroma, and maybe Mastodon)

## Usage

Insert `<FediverseCommentSection>` tag to your blog template with proper attributes. Import default stylesheet if you like.
